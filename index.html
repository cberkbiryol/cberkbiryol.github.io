        In the summer of 2012, I have done some fieldwork in Turkey that involved deploying over 50 seismometers to record not only the earthquakes
        in Turkey, but also the earthquakes all around the globe. If you are thinking it is too technical of a job, you are wrong!
        Most of my time was spent on digging holes in the ground, mixing and pouring concrete (Not to mention carrying around those heavy concrete bags)...
