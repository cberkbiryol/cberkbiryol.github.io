            I have done fieldwork in Turkey in 2012, in which I deployed some seismometers to record not only local Earthquakes in Turkey, but also earthquakes all areound the globe. If you are thinking it is too technical of a job you are wrong! Most of my time was spent on digging holes and mixing and pouring concrete (Not to mention carrying around those materials around)...
